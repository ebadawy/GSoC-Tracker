# Sprint 1

Well, what was planed here is to get @DiegoTc last year work and migrate it to jekyll, but since there is some troubles in getting his work to the repo, I'll do most of the work as it goes:

## Week 1

###What is done:

1- Add bootstrap&Jquery 1.9.1 files to static dir.

2- Add a submodule for ace.

3- Create the code version of bonecard and test it.

###Issues:

1- There were some dely in time wating for @DiegoTc to get his patch.

2- @jadonk told me that there is two versions of bonecard with different sizes the large one called "zoomed", looking for it to work on its code instead doing another one form scratch.

3- Need to be more DRY in css code, and @jadonk suggested to "Inherit bonecard-code from bonecard-zoomed".

4- There is another version on ace already in static dir but it is kind of outdated, so need to use the new one with reasonable merge instead of using submodules.

5- Due to my exams, the output is not the best at all, and afraid that this issue will be in the next week also.

### Next weak goals:

1- Fix past week issues.

2- Make a skeleton for "Create Tutorial" page.
